Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

Note to HW reviewe: I have run my pages through an online HTML validator, and some bugs were fixed but others I did not understand what is wrong with them since my page stil displays just fine or at least it looks that way. Validator: https://validator.w3.org/

Additionally, I have looked at the "problems" section in VS, but what it points as an error is exactly as Bootstrap says it should look like so I am confused here as well. 

Although the webpage isn't perfect, I think it encompasses the gist of the homework requirements. 

In terms of @media, my understanding is that bootsrap already contains these in its css. I am not sure if part of the requirement was to include at least one within our html file(s).
